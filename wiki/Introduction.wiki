= Goal =

My Goal was to create an infinity mirror with a led matrix that would display various news headlines. and by touching the mirror, you can change the news feed.


= Issues =

Not really an issue, but the code allocates 62 chars for each headline. So if a headline is really long, it may be cutoff when trying to read it on the display.
