= Parts =

 * Large floating Picture frame (uses two pieces of glass to hold pictures)
 * Mirror tint for windows (and tools to apply it)
 * Four Maxim Max7221 chips
 * Four LED matrices compatible with the MAX7221 chip 
 * Large perf-board to accommodate the width of the 4 LED matrices and Max chips.
 * 3/4 wooded square rod (enough to build a rectangular space between the two pieces of glass and a inner perimeter of 40 inches)
 * Arduino Uno
 * Super glue
 * Lots of wire
 * Four resistors that are capable of controlling your LED matrix with the Max 7221 chip
 * Four force sensors
 * One meter addressable LED strip


= Assembly =

 # Solder the four matrices, resistors, and Max7221 chips together on the perf-board. (ZIP chips can be used if you think you might reuse the Max chips in the future)
 # Apply the Mirror tint to the two pieces of glass
 # Build a rectangular frame with a inner perimeter of one meter 
 # Glue the LED strip to the inside of the frame
 # Sandwich the frame between the two pieces of glass
