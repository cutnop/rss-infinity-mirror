= Parts =

 * Large floating Picture frame (uses two pieces of glass to hold pictures)
 * Mirror tint for windows (and tools to apply it)
 * Four Maxim Max7221 chips
 * Four LED matrices compatible with the MAX7221 chip (common cathode)
 * Large perf-board to accommodate the width of the 4 LED matrices and Max chips.
 * 3/4 wood square rod (enough to build a rectangular space between the two pieces of glass and a inner perimeter of 40 inches)
 * Arduino Uno
 * Super glue
 * Lots of wire
 * Four resistors that are capable of controlling your LED matrix with the Max 7221 chip
 * One push button with appropriate resistor
 * One meter addressable LED strip


= Assembly =

 # Solder the four matrices, resistors, and Max7221 chips together on the perf-board. (ZIP chips can be used if you think you might reuse the Max chips in the future)
 # Apply the Mirror tint to the two pieces of glass
 # Build a rectangular frame with a inner perimeter of one meter 
 # Glue the LED strip to the inside of the frame
 # Cut a small notch in the frame so the wires can be reached from the outside of the frame
 # Apply glue and sandwich the frame between the two pieces of glass but make sure the mirror tint is on the outside of the sandwich
 # Build another frame around the perf-board and matrix to keep it level against the glass and support the mirror
 # Because the matrix is sitting outside of the infinity mirror, the leds wont be bright enough to shine through both pieces of glass. To fix this, cut out a rectangle the size of the matrix display in the back mirror tint
 # Glue the matrix and frame to the back of the infinity mirror
 # Wire the button to the digital pin 2
 # Wire the data pin from the led strip to pin 4
 # Wire the clock pin from the led strip to pin 5
 # Wire the data pin from the MAX7221 chips to pin 10
 # Wire the clock pin from the MAX7221 chips to pin 9
 # Wire the load pin from the MAX7221 chips to pin 8
 # Wire the appropriate Vcc and GND
